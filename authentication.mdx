TerraTwin uses API keys for authentication.
Right now you can create personal keys.
Service accounts are coming soon and will give you dedicated keys per integration.
Until then, one well-managed personal key is enough to get started.

## Key visibility

If you lose the key:

- Revoke the old key in **[Manage API Keys](https://www.terratwin.com/account/settings/api-key-manager)**
- Generate a new one
- Update any services that use it

## Security basics

Keep API keys out of logs, repos, and frontends.

- Treat keys like **passwords**
- Store them in a **secret manager** or environment variables
- Rotate keys if you suspect exposure
