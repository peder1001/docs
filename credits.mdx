## Credits & usage

TerraTwin uses a **credit-based** model for API usage. Every request consumes credits from your account, based on the work required to model and calculate your shipment.

  <Card title="What is a credit?" icon="coins">
    A credit is the basic unit of work TerraTwin charges for when modelling and calculating transport emissions.  
    In practice: **1 shipment leg = 1 credit**, regardless of distance, mode mix, or route complexity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Who owns the credits?" icon="users">
    Credits belong to your **Account**. Today, each account is personal, but shared multi-user accounts are coming.
    All personal keys, future service accounts, and integrations draw from the **same credit pool**.

### Lifecycle of credits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up & get free credits">
    Every new TerraTwin account starts with **50 courtesy credits**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Top up with pay-as-you-go credits">
    When your free credits run out, you can **[purchase additional credits](https://www.terratwin.com/account/credits)** on a pay-as-you-go basis.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credits are consumed per shipment leg">
    For each request, TerraTwin splits your shipment into **legs** – **1 leg = 1 credit**
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
Credits are tracked at the **account level** and shared across all API keys – including personal keys and service accounts.

## How credit consumption works

TerraTwin breaks every shipment into **legs** – single, continuous movements using one mode of transport.

A leg is typically:

- An **air** segment: airport → airport  
- A **road** segment: hub → address or address → hub  
- A **rail** segment: rail terminal → rail terminal  
- A **sea** segment: port → port  

You are charged **1 credit per leg**.

<Note>
A road leg where a truck boards a ferry and continues after landing is still treated as **one road leg → one credit**.
